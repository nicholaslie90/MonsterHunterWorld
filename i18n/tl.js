//==Editing Notes==
//The only thing you need to translate is the right-hand side of the colon, surrounded by quotes. ‘Quick Search’ (for example) and so on.
//When editing the translations, also take note of the spaces, as they are intended. For example,
//'armors-total-fire-defense': 'Total Fire Def: ', (note there is a space after the “Def:” so it becoems “Def: “ ). This is intended.

//This document will continue to evolve and grow as the app grows and modified over time.
//There is no need to edit the // values, as this is only used for identifier purposes of the app (indicates which screen it is).

//To insert words with single quotes, use backslash, for example, if you want to write "it's", you'd write "it\'s".
//To insert new lines, use "\n".

//PRO TIP: Editing multiple instances of a word / parts of a sentence
//Double click on a word / parts of a sentence, then if you're on Mac, use Cmd+D to highlight multiple instances of that word.
//If you're on Windows, use Ctrl+D instead.

//Once a string is translated, remove the //NEW comment

//==What You Will Get==
//I will be upfront, I cannot promise you anything of monetary value by helping me in translating this app,
//but I will make sure to put your name in the About section as one of the contributors to this app.
//I thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping me in making this app even better.

Once at the top you can jump down some kind of well where the last Magmacore stands, you can destroy it now but it\'s possible Nergigante show up before that and you\'ll have to come back later. \n\nGo take care of that weak version of Nergigante, it will flee after enough damage be done to it, you then need to destroy any remaining Magmacore. Once all Magmacore are destroyed, wait for a Wingdrake to bring you on the Barrier. You can find another rock to break on Zorah\'s right flank while waiting. \n\nOn the Barrier, load cannons and fire, making sure to line up the cannon with Zorah\'s position, try to fire 5 cannon balls at once to exhaust Zorah Magdaros. When there\'s no more ammo, switch to another cannon. At some point, the Field Team Leader will talk about the Dragonslayer, don\'t use it yet, keep firing the cannons, moving toward the boat little by little. When ?NPC? says Zorah Magdaros is charging up for a big attack, use the lever on the boat to activate the Dragonslayer and stop Zorah\'s attack.

    'critical-bounties-important-notes': 'There are three researchers that you can encounter out in the field: the Endemic Life Researcher, the Lynian Researcher and the Piscine Researcher.\n\nWhen you set out on an expedition, only one Researcher will spawn in the zone. Which Researcher spawns, is displayed on the World Map when you choose your expedition destination. Every time you complete an assignment, expedition or investigation, it changes which Researcher spawns. That’s why it is important to check the World Map regularly.\n\nIt is important to talk to each Researcher in each zone in order to progress through the critical bounties of each Researcher. Since it is random which Researcher spawns (see previous note), it is easy to miss out on these critical bounties.\n\nIf a Researcher has a bounty to offer, they will appear as a yellow exclamation mark (!) on the map. I didn’t always see these marks on the map and that’s why I missed out on these critical bounties. Once you are on an expedition, open your World Map and use the L1/R1 buttons to select the Endemic Life filter to make it easier to spot.\n\nIf a Researcher has no bounty to offer, they will appear as a bright green dot (.) on the map.\n\nAfter you complete a critical bounty, you can talk to the respective Researcher to inform him/her that you completed the bounty. However, you always have to talk to the Research Center in Astera to complete the bounty and receive the rewards.\n\nIf you didn’t talk to the Researcher after completing a bounty and you are about to talk to them in a new zone to accept a new bounty, it is possible that you have to talk to the Researcher twice. One time to inform him/her that you completed the previous bounty. Another time to initiate the critical bounty of the new zone.\n\nChoosing the Low Rank or High Rank destination doesn’t matter, except for Dragon’s Recess which is High Rank only.\n\nLynian Bounties: Whenever you find doodles, you can mark them with your scout flies and they will guide you to the next doodle. Doing this leads you to the locations listed below. After befriending a clan, you can talk to your Palico in your room or at the Research Base. Your Palico will then tell you the new tricks it learned.',
