# MHW Guide Wiki Companion App
100% built with React Native

If you guys are interested in maintaining the project, feel free to drop me an email at nicholaslie90@gmail.com.
It's highly recommended that you are familiar with RN development.

I have to admit that this code is not the best implementation, since I didn't use any state management libraries. 

## Installation & Debugging
1. Clone the repo.
2. npm install
3. npm run start

## Building
Let me know if you want me to build a new version to the Play Store/App Store, since the app is tied to my personal account.

The Play Store has a 150MB limit per app.
